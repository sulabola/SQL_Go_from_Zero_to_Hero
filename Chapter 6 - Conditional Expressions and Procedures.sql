-- This chapter covers Conditional Expressions and Procedures

-- Here we focus on applying logical operators and functionality within the SQL code.
-- We will learn key words: CASE, COALESCE, NULLIF, CASR, Views, Import and Export functionality

-- "CASE" Statement

-- We can use the CASE statement to only execute SQL code when certain conditions are met.
-- Thus, it is similar to IF/ELSE statements in other programming languages.

-- There are two ways to use this:
-- 1. General CASE statement
-- 2. CASE expression

-- Note: Both methods may lead to same results.

-- General syntax:	CASE
--						WHEN condition1 THEN result1
--						WHEN condition2 THEN result2
--						ELSE some_other_result
--					END
