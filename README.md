# SQL: Go From Zero to Hero

This repository documents my learning from the Udemy course *The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero*, taught by Jose Portilla, Head of Data Science at Pierian Training. The content and examples included here are based on the concepts, exercises, and hands-on SQL practices covered in the course. Through this repository, I aim to reinforce my understanding of PostgreSQL, SQL querying, data analysis techniques, and real-world database workflows while building a structured reference for future analytical projects.

### Programming Language

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system)

[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) (pgAdmin is the most popular and feature-rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL)

### Database

The sample database used in these exercises is available in the `Database` folder of the repository. It also contains an image that describes the table names, column names of each table, and relationships between the tables.

### Chapter 1 – SQL Statement Fundamentals

This chapter provides an introduction to core SQL querying techniques. This chapter includes syntax explanations, examples, and concise notes on essential commands such as `SELECT`, `SELECT DISTINCT`, `COUNT`, filtering with `WHERE`, sorting with `ORDER BY`, limiting results with `LIMIT`, and using conditional operators including `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, and `ILIKE`. These foundational skills support effective data exploration and form the basis for more advanced SQL analysis in later chapters.

### Chapter 2 – GROUP BY Statements:

This chapter introduces essential SQL techniques for summarizing and analyzing data using `GROUP BY`. It covers core aggregation functions such as `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`, along with practical examples that demonstrate how to group records effectively. The chapter also explains how to filter grouped results using the `HAVING` clause, enabling more refined analytical queries in real datasets.

### Chapter 3 – JOINS

This chapter focuses on combining data across multiple tables using SQL JOIN operations. It introduces the purpose and structure of JOINs, along with the use of the `AS` statement for creating readable aliases. The chapter covers `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to handle different data relationship scenarios, as well as the `UNION` operator for merging results from multiple queries. Practical examples are included to demonstrate how joins are applied in real-world relational database queries.

---

### Chapter 4 – Advanced SQL Commands

This chapter focuses on advanced SQL techniques used for more complex data analysis tasks. It covers working with timestamp data using `EXTRACT` and `TO_CHAR`, applying mathematical functions and operators, and performing text manipulation with string functions. The chapter also introduces ``subqueries`` and ``self joins``, providing practical examples that reflect real-world analytical scenarios and advanced query logic.

---

### Chapter 5 – Creating Databases and Tables

This chapter focuses on database and table creation fundamentals in SQL. It covers core data types, primary keys and foreign keys, and the use of constraints to enforce data integrity. Practical examples demonstrate how to create tables using `CREATE TABLE`, insert and modify data with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, and manage table structures using `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP TABLE`. The chapter also introduces `CHECK` constraints to validate data entries, providing a solid foundation for designing and maintaining relational databases.

---

### Chapter 6 – Conditional Expressions and Procedures

This chapter focuses on adding logic, flexibility, and structure to SQL queries using conditional expressions and database objects. It covers the use of `CASE` statements for conditional logic, handling missing or null values with `COALESCE` and `NULLIF`, and type conversion using `CAST`. The chapter also introduces SQL views for query abstraction and demonstrates how to import and export data efficiently, reflecting common real-world database workflows.
