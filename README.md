# SQL: Go From Zero to Hero

This repository documents my learning from the Udemy course *The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero*, taught by Jose Portilla, Head of Data Science at Pierian Training. The content and examples included here are based on the concepts, exercises, and hands-on SQL practices covered in the course. Through this repository, I aim to reinforce my understanding of PostgreSQL, SQL querying, data analysis techniques, and real-world database workflows while building a structured reference for future analytical projects.

### Programming Language

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system)

[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) (pgAdmin is the most popular and feature-rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL)

### Database

The sample database used in these exercises is available in the `Database` folder of the repository. It also contains an image that describes the table names, column names of each table, and relationships between the tables.

### Chapter 1 – SQL Statement Fundamentals

This chapter provides an introduction to core SQL querying techniques. This chapter includes syntax explanations, examples, and concise notes on essential commands such as `SELECT`, `SELECT DISTINCT`, `COUNT`, filtering with `WHERE`, sorting with `ORDER BY`, limiting results with `LIMIT`, and using conditional operators including `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`, and `ILIKE`. These foundational skills support effective data exploration and form the basis for more advanced SQL analysis in later chapters.
