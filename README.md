# SQL: Go From Zero to Hero

This repository documents my learning from the Udemy course *The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero*, taught by Jose Portilla, Head of Data Science at Pierian Training. The content and examples included here are based on the concepts, exercises, and hands-on SQL practices covered in the course. Through this repository, I aim to reinforce my understanding of PostgreSQL, SQL querying, data analysis techniques, and real-world database workflows while building a structured reference for future analytical projects.
